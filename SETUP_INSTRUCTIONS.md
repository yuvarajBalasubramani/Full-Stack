## 🔧 What You Need To Do (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Google Maps API Key (Required)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "API Key"
5. Copy your API key

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Open `.env` file in the project root and replace `your_google_maps_api_key_here` with your actual API key:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyC...your_actual_key_here

**Note:** Google Pay is already configured with a TEST merchant ID, so it will work immediately!

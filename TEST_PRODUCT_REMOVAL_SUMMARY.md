# Test Product Removal Summary

## Issue
A "Test Product" was appearing on the dashboard that needed to be removed.

## Investigation
1. âœ… Checked MongoDB database - No "Test Product" found in database
2. âœ… Checked mockData.js - No "Test Product" found
3. âœ… Searched entire frontend codebase - Found 2 instances

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/Hero.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Removed hardcoded test product array
- Removed ProductCard import (no longer needed)
- Removed products grid section that was displaying the test product
- Cleaned up the Hero component to only show the welcome banner and feature cards

**Before:**
```javascript
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Test Product", price: 1000, image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150", description: "Test", rating: 5, reviews: 10, stock: 20 }
];
```

**After:**
- Removed the entire products array and display logic

### 2. `src/pages/admin/AdminCart.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Removed test product from initialProducts array
- Left empty array with comment for future database integration

**Before:**
```javascript
const initialProducts = [
  { id: 1, name: "Test Product", price: 1000, image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150", description: "Test", rating: 5, reviews: 10, stock: 20 }
];
```

**After:**
```javascript
const initialProducts = [
  // Products will be loaded from the database
];
```

## Verification
âœ… Searched entire codebase - No more instances of "Test Product" found

## Result
ðŸŽ‰ **Test product successfully removed from the dashboard!**

The dashboard will now only display products from the MongoDB database (8 seed products) through the ProductGrid component.

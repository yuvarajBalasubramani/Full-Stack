# Track Order Button - Testing Checklist

## ‚úÖ Changes Completed

### Files Modified:

### Issue: Track Order button doesn't respond
**Solution:** 
- Refresh the browser (Ctrl+R or F5)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Issue: Modal opens but shows errors
**Possible Causes:**
1. **Old order without tracking data**
   - Solution: Place a new order
2. **Google Maps API not configured**
   - Expected: Map section shows error
   - Order details should still display correctly

### Issue: Modal doesn't open at all
**Check:**
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify OrderTracking.jsx file exists
3. Restart development server:
   ```powershell
   # Stop servers (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   # Restart frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The Track Order feature is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ "Track Order" button is clickable
2. ‚úÖ Clicking button opens the tracking modal
3. ‚úÖ Modal displays order information correctly
4. ‚úÖ Order timeline shows status history
5. ‚úÖ Delivery partner information is visible
6. ‚úÖ Close button works properly
7. ‚úÖ Can track multiple orders (click track on different orders)

## üìù Notes

### For New Orders Only
- Full tracking functionality (including map) only works for **new orders** placed after this fix
- Old orders in localStorage won't have `deliveryTracking` or `shippingAddress.coordinates`
- To test fully: **Place a fresh order**

### Google Maps API
- Map visualization requires Google Maps API key
- Without API key: Map shows loading/error state (this is normal)
- Order details and tracking info still work without map

### Mock Data
Current tracking data is mock/demo data:
- Delivery person: Rajesh Kumar
- Location: Delhi area
- In production, this would be real-time data from backend

## üéØ Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. Open app ‚Üí Add product to cart
2. Checkout ‚Üí Fill details ‚Üí Place order
3. Go to Order History
4. Click "Track Order"
5. ‚úÖ Modal opens with order details = **SUCCESS!**
